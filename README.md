# Mininet-Simulation-Conf
Installing Mininet on Ubuntu 20.04. Creating a Mininet script for customised Spine-Leaf Topology and generating VNE by saving into pickle file.

Mininet Environment Welcome to our Mininet environment repository! This repository provides a flexible and powerful platform for creating virtualized spine-leaf network topologies for educational, research, and testing purposes. Mininet allows you to emulate complex network scenarios by creating customizable network topologies with switches, hosts, and controllers, all within a single machine.

Key Features:

Topology Customization: Design custom network topologies by specifying the number of switches, hosts, and their interconnections. Fine-tune network parameters such as CPU limits, bandwidth, and delay for a realistic network emulation experience.

OpenFlow Support: Leverage OpenFlow capabilities for dynamic and programmable network behavior. Experiment with SDN (Software-Defined Networking) concepts and protocols.

Python Integration: Use Python scripts to create, configure, and manage Mininet topologies. Seamlessly integrate Mininet with other Python-based networking tools and libraries.

Experimentation and Testing: Test network protocols, algorithms, and applications in a controlled and reproducible environment. Simulate real-world network scenarios to analyze performance and behavior.

Extensibility: Extend Mininet's functionality by integrating it with additional tools, controllers, or custom scripts. Contribute to the Mininet community by sharing your custom modules and extensions.

Getting Started:

Installation:

Follow the installation instructions in the documentation to set up Mininet and Ryu controller on your machine.

Install Mininet
